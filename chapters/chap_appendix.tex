\chapter{Appendix (e.g. Code)} \label{chap:javacode}

The Appendix section is useful to provide additional information that does not necessarily contribute to the main work of the thesis. However, it may still be relevant to explain some background information or provide additional details of your experiments. 

The same rules as for the main text apply here as well. Always introduce a section, describe figures and tables, and reference them in the descriptions.
