\section*{Research questions and/or Hypotheses}
Describe your contribution with respect to concepts, theory, and technical goals. Ensure that the scientific and engineering challenges stand out so that the reader can easily recognize that you are planning to solve an advanced problem. 
Extract the key point of your research and formulate questions to answer them.
State hypotheses and describe what led to these hypotheses.
You should be able to interpret all possible outcomes with respect to your hypotheses and/or questions, no matter the fact, if they are concurrent with your assumption or not.
