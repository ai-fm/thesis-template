\section*{Threats to Validity}

Think about your thesis project and identify potential threats to validity. Are any flaws in the analysis, limitations on the applicability? Think primarily about external and internal validity; perhaps also about construct and conclusion validity. For instance, are your results generalizable? Do your results apply to practical cases, and can you translate them into another context? Furthermore, is the conclusion you draw warranted? Does your conclusion cover alternative explanations? Provide evidence.\\

\noindent What are the limitations of your solution, give a brief outlook on how these could be addressed. In which scope is your solution valid, what is possible and what not?\\

\noindent Why did you choose not to address some problem you are aware of? If so, clearly explain the reason not addressing them. For example, the literature you will not review or the methodology you are not using; explain why you decided not to use them.
